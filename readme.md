    ```csharp
    _openAIClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
        new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "your-openai-api-key");
    _replicateClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
        new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "your-replicate-api-key");
    ```

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

2. The application will read the system prompt from [system_prompt.txt]) and display it.

3. Start chatting with the AI assistant by typing your messages in the console.

4. The AI assistant will respond with text and synthesized audio.

5. The program will delete the audio file once played for cleanup You can comment out the code to prevent that if you wish.
